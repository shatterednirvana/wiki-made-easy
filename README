Wiki Made Easy makes Wikipedia fun by grabbing random articles and trying to
pique your interest with just the first sentence. It presents a link that
provides more information on the article, and a link that you can use to grab
a different random article. It's written in Go App Engine and uses the URLFetch
library to grab Wikipedia articles and the regexp library to filter out various
parts of the HTML that comes back.

Comments welcome - enjoy!
